<b>Description:</b>  Implemented UNET for segmenting retinal blood vessels from medical images, improving segmentation performance for better diagnosis of ophthalmic conditions.<br>
<b>Technologies:</b> Python, PyTorch, UNET, Medical Image Segmentation<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> I gained a deeper understanding of medical image segmentation techniques, which enhanced my overall skills in applying segmentation to medical imaging projects.<br>


<b>5. Building a Neural Network From Scratch for Digit Recognition</b><br>

<b>Description:</b>   In this project, I built a neural network entirely from scratch, without using any machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. I implemented all the core components, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and gradient descent. The network was trained on a digit recognition dataset, where the goal was to classify handwritten digits.<br>

<b>6. Makemore: Character-Level Name Generation (Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Tutorial)</b><br>

<b>Description:</b>   This project was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's YouTube video "The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore." I followed along with the tutorial, coding the implementation of a character-level autoregressive model for generating names. Through this process, I learned about sequence modeling, embeddings, neural network layers, and how to build a simple character-level generative model from scratch. The model was trained on a dataset of names and can generate new names character by character based on learned patterns.
Technologies: Python, Neural Networks, Autoregressive Modeling<br>
<b>Technologies:</b> Python, Numpy (for matrix operations), Neural Networks<br>
<b>Outcome:</b> By coding along with Karpathy's tutorial, I gained practical knowledge of language modeling, deep learning fundamentals, and sequence generation. Special thanks to Andrej Karpathy for providing this hands-on learning experience through his insightful content.<br>
