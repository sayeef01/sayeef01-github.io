<b>1. OBoctNet: Enhancing Ophthalmic Biomarker Detection through Active Learning and Explainable AI in Radiological Analysis</b><br>

<i>Accepted for publication in Cognitive Computation (Springer, Q1, IF: 4.3)</i>

<b>Description:</b> This paper, an extension of my undergraduate thesis, introduces a novel two-stage training strategy for enhancing ophthalmic biomarker identification in OCT scans using the OLIVES dataset, which contains only 12% labeled data. By leveraging the OBoctNet model with active learning and GradCAM for interpretability, the approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, achieving a remarkable 23% performance increase across 50% of biomarkers compared to prior studies.
